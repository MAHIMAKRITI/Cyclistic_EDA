<b>Introduction:</b><br><br>

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! This case study represents course 8 “Capstone project” of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximising the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the data analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.In this notebook I analyze the 5.6M data points present in the dataset provided to us.Please go through the Python notebook to checkout the analysis I did and the conclusion I derived from them which lead to my own set of five suggestions for the marketing department.
